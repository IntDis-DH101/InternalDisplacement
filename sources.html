 <p>Our data set was provided by th Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) and can be downloaded <a href="https://www.internal-displacement.org/sites/default/files/IDMC_IDI_values_2020%20final.xlsx">here.</a></p>

  </div>

 <p>The data was generated by gathering materials from multiple government agencies and national organizations. This data is then quality checked in-house by internal and external review groups to discuss the possible limitations and caveats of the data with partners in the field. <br><br>

The original sources primarily come from Government Agencies, UN organizations, IOM DTM (international org for migration digital tracking matrix), humanitarian clusters, IFRC, and local authorities. Secondary sources are also used if information cannot be found at the primary level. These include local/international NGOs (non-governmental organizations), civil society and human rights organizations, and academia. Lastly, if reliability can be assessed, a third tier of information sources may be used in a few cases. This includes international and local media, affected populations, and non-state armed groups. 
Due to the nature of internal displacement, data gathering may become problematic when pulling information from strictly one source, thus resulting in 3 tiers of data sourcing. <br><br>

IDMC is partnered and funded by a wide range of international organizations. These include USAID (US agency for international development), Norway's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Sweden's International Development Cooperation Agency, the European Commission, the international organization for migration, Liechtenstein's Ministry of Foreign affairs, the federal foreign office of Germany, and the Swiss Federal department of foreign affairs. 
<br><br>
Given that the dataset only includes indexes of each country's impact, context, and policies, we would not be able to fully understand the exact policies and circumstances within each country that led to the given index. The indexes allow us to compare the shared challenges between countries that lead to internal displacement. However, the identification of specific events, such as environmental disasters and the adopted policies, as well as the stories of the displaced people, are left out of this dataset. We will need to use secondary sources to dive deeper into the index values to create a narrative of what exactly led to the variation in indexes and the possible influences from the cultures and beliefs of the people residing in each country. The combination of the dataset with secondary sources will provide a larger picture of internal displacement in each country and provide greater insight into how we can address it. <br><br>

The data is organized by region, country, scale of displacement, severity of displacement, economic impact, context, policies and capacities. The key variables are organized into 3 main categories: Impact, Context, and Policies & capacities. <br><br>

Some of the key variables include economic impact, severity score, scale of displacement indicator, environmental sustainability indicator, socio-economic development indicator, and security & political stability indicator. These variables will be helpful in determining the correlation for internal displacement within the listed regions. <br><br>

Information from 46 countries is included in the data set, ranging from Afghanistan to Yemen. The major regions included are Europe and Central Asia, South Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and North Africa, the Americas. There are 46 out of 195 countries included in the data set, which all happen to be Global South countries. <br><br>

The dataset was created to help governments by providing them with reliable information on the challenges of their countries and identifying the specific areas in which solutions could be implemented while highlighting the main drivers of displacement. 
The data set allows governments to develop specific tools for their own countries, such as intervention responses and creating budgets. The information also assists governments with fulfilling multilateral reporting requirements such as the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Sendai Framework on Disaster Risk. The data set is aimed toward country-level stakeholders and policy making. <br><br>

Instead of the three main categorical variables, some key variables included in the detailed columns could provide more raw data on how these scores were calculated. The context of these indices would provide more clarity in what they mean. It would be practical that the sources of where the scale of the scores and indicators came from were based on the raw data of the impact of internal displacement, whether that be categorical or quantitative data from the conflict and environment data.We could use secondary sources and investigate how IDMC found their data to get their scores to gain context for the data.<br><br>

Another good feature to add to the data would be to obtain the metadata for the three different source types for each country and field. This would show us how reliable the data is for each country and can give us a better picture of why there would be an error analysis in that portion of the data. This would also give us more information about the data silence from lack of sources or lack of data from certain countries or events.
We will also make sure to address the missing elements of our dataset for transparency sake. From what we found out from our secondary sources, it was easy to navigate through what sources made the indicators like severity score.
