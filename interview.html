					<h2 class="content__title">A Look into the Lives of the Displaced</h2> 
					<h3 class="content__subtitle">"My mom would pull out drums and just start singing to distract us [the children] from the bullets."</h3>
					<p> Patil, a 21-year-old Syrian now living in Southern California, recalls this memory from her childhood in her hometown, Aleppo, Syria. Her life changed as a young child when an anti-government rebel group emerged and attempted to seize control of the state. She lived through a year and a half of the war, and she recalls the longstanding hope of her people. Everyone tried to continue with their everyday lives. Only their daily lives now consisted of seeking immediate shelter as soon as they heard a bomb or heard bullets being shot and living in fear as if it was their last day. Patil recalls a time she was riding the bus with her mother; they both had to wear hijabs to prevent themselves from being targeted. During the ride, a young man in their twenties, sitting across from them, was shot dead in an instant. Also, one day while attending school, there was an explosion next to her school facility, and her mom went to pick her up. Even incidents like this did not stop her from attending school. People did not want to suspend their lives because of the war; it was a coping mechanism to retain their hope and avoid developing depression and mental health disorders. People also had to keep working to put food on the table every night. <br><br>

As a child and a Christian living in her own country, she was targeted and at times, she had to sleep in a bathtub in her neighbor's house downstairs to protect herself from bullets at night. This was to avoid strikes and protect herself since her home which was on the top floor was a vulnerable area for attacks. She still wishes she could  return to her homeland, but as of now, more than a decade after the war started, it remains an impossible reality. Instead, she lives "through the country in pictures," and she knows that if she returned to Syria, it would be nearly impossible to escape again. <br><br>

Despite living through the terror of an ongoing war and going about everyday life knowing that one could die, Patil noted that this was not the worst part about living through the war in Syria. It was not having her immediate family with her. She was about ten years old when her loving father, whom she shared a unique bond with, passed away, and her two older sisters moved to America because they were engaged. <br><br>

Patil's grandparents had lived in Qamishli, a small city in northeastern Syria, for most of their lives. The war, however, pushed them to move to Aleppo when it became too dangerous to live in Qamishli. They held on until the last bit of hope thinking they could stay in the town they had grown up in and created a life for themselves. Instead, Aleppo became their permanent home for about a decade until recently in late 2022, they were granted refugee status in Germany. Like Patli's grandparents, millions of people abandon their homes in search of safety and security, many unable to return home because it is too dangerous.
