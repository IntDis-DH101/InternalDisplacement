  <h3 class="w3-center">Regional Conclusions</h3>
  <p class="w3-center"><em>Middle East & North Africa</p>
  <p>Given the political landscape and natural disaster prone environment in the Middle Easter and North Africa (MENA) region, we conducted an analysis of each country’s internal displacement based on their socioeconomic development indicator (SDI), environmental sustainability indicator (ESI), and security and political stability indicator – all in the context of the overall internal displacement index and increases in new internal displacement in the 2020. Based on our findings, the MENA region for the most part experiences a correlation between GDP and political stability and absence of violence, yet Iraq stands as an outlier with a misalignment between the two measures. Yemen was the most unstable country in the MENA region in terms of political and security stability, as well as socioeconomic development due to its repercussions after being in a war. In terms of environmental sustainability, the MENA region is geographically prone to semi-arid and desert areas which will lead to water management issues in the future. Syria had the highest indicator in terms of environmental sustainability and Iraq had the lowest. Overall, through our analysis of the MENA region, internal displacement is largely a consequence of the combined and cascading impacts of political, social, and environment instability existing within each of the countries. The ongoing pressure of these factors have only continued to intensify and accelerate the increase in vulnerable internally displaced people in the MENA region, making it crucial to spread awareness of the underlying and intersecting attributes leading to their circumstances. </p>
    <p class="w3-center"><em>East Asia & Pacific</p>
  <p>The East Asia Pacific region is extremely prone to natural disasters, having the highest rates of  disaster displacement population across all regions.  To better understand the government’s response to the given circumstances, we investigated the policies implemented in the countries. While the majority had solid government support and action against disasters, we found that Thailand scored lower due to a lack of long-term disaster recovery support. Despite this, Thailand’s governmental support is fundamentally sound and the significant displacement statistics may be the result of their constant exposure to natural disasters. </p>
      <p class="w3-center"><em>South Asia</p>
  <p>For the region of South Asia, we conducted a general analysis of the national policies compared to the region's environmental sustainability, given that it experiences some of the highest numbers of displacements due to disasters. We found that South Asia, on average, has a high number of policies, yet the region's environmental sustainability reflects different results. The regions with the most significant discrepancies are Afghanistan and Sri Lanka. The observed trend can be justified through the types of strategies and policies implemented. Governments often impose preemptive measures that do not offer durable and sustainable solutions, and there is an absence of long-term policymaking that addresses displacement, particularly in the context of natural hazards. This results in severe impacts on displaced individuals and the victims of the climate disasters.</p>

    <h3 class="w3-center">Further Throughts for the Future</h3>
  <p class="w3-center"><em>Place in Literature</p>
  <p>Transnational forced migration has historically received more attention compared to internal displacement to the extent that there are no formal organizations for internally displaced persons (IDPs) like the is for refugees, the UNHCR acts as an agency of support for refugees. The academic coverage of internal displacement, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa region, has observed some common themes among IDPs and byproducts of internal displacement. A large number of internally displaced people live under the poverty line and find it difficult to survive in new environments. Due to financial constraints, children often withdraw from school and enter the workforce at an early age to provide additional income. Thus, there is a strong correlation between education levels and national GDP. Education is also affected in the form of war which destroys houses, and schools serve as shelters which inhibits children from obtaining the knowledge and skills necessary to one day stimulate and drive the economy. Among the most prevalent push factors noted by scholarship for internal displacement are conflict, violence, and climate disasters. Some scholars urge policies and aid, but within this support system, they insist on a distinction between humanitarian aid and development aid. (Can elaborate on this as a continuation of the narrative but not for this assignment). Similarly, literature suggests more media coverage as a way to educate the general public and continues to emphasize the necessary enforcement of international law and positions academia as a prerequisite for policy and advocacy efforts. </p>
      <p class="w3-center"><em>Significance</p>
  <p>Despite having over 51.9 million cases in the past year (2021), the topic of internal displacement is still widely unknown to the public. Many of us have the luxury of living in a conflict and disaster free environment, making the idea of internal displacement an unfamiliar concept. Internal Displacement Persons (IDPs) encompass all age groups and displacement impacts them in several ways from food insecurity, homelessness, unemployment, lack of education, and declining health. By recognizing the problem and shining light on this issue we hope to encourage greater support and awareness of the issue many countries currently face. 
Upon investigating the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, East Asia Pacific region, and South Asia region we found that each have their own distinct problems which cause internal displacement to be particularly bad in certain countries. In the MENA region, the unstable government structure and lack of effort in supporting the displaced resulted in consistently high conflict displacement statistics. On the other hand, the East Asia Pacific region had the highest number of disaster displacements, which were worsened by the likelihood of disasters and their densely populated urban landscape. In the South Asia region, we found that though governments were implementing policies to combat disasters, many of the policies were preemptive and were unable to result in durable solutions. Stressing the scale of these issues is essential to get policymakers, global citizens, and organizations to understand the impact environmental, socioeconomic, and political factors have on IDPs. In order to become a developed city or country, there must be access to proper resources, infrastructure, and a plan with the political system to get the country on its feet and keep the citizens in the country to contribute to building its own community.
