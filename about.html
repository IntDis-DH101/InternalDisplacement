          <p>Ivan Ma is a fifth year Computer Science Major. His role for this project was Data Visualization Specialist and Editor. The duties he performed were making every submission and format valid for the group assignments, content of the website, implementation details, and verifying the data visualizations were clear and purposeful. This leads to his second role which was Data Visualization Specialist, which manages and creates data visualizations from tableau to speak clearly to the narrative and draw conclusions behind the trends we saw. He also developed the outline for the website and made sure we were organized in our vision for the project by collectively accumulating the small bits of content and ideas and uniting them together.</p>

        <li class="w3-black w3-xlarge w3-padding-32">Sources</li>
        <li class="w3-padding-16">Our research was from the Internal Displacement Monitoring Center (IDMC) with an emphasis on the regional comparison. We have emphasized several regions from the dataset. We have the most secondary data and focus for the Middle Eastern and North African region (MENA). We also emphasized the South Asia region to talk about the policies and GDP. We expanded in the Sub Saharan region about conflict and violence. IDMC has made reports for 2020 about each of these regions while investigating multiple factors of environmental policies, security and national policies, socio economic impact, and population to determine what is going on for the causes and effects of internal displacement For our timeline, we modeled a timeline graph that comes from multiple articles about the disasters of the countries in the East Asia and Pacific region. This originated to look for data to fit our narrative about the seasonal disasters that affect East Asia and the Pacific Region. We wanted to speak about the data silence in the data given from the Internal Displacement Persons (IDPs) rates despite the impact and context categories being relatively good for the region. In other words, the problem could not be pinpointed to a category from the data and it would lead to not many IDPs. However, the number still exists, so we investigated that natural disasters could be the cause. We also looked at Google scholar and sources that spanned from the IDMC to get secondary sources about countries’ policy implementation, government, and economy. One of our group members also got a primary source interview with a Syrian refugee to speak about her experiences and what she witnessed.</li>

        <li class="w3-dark-grey w3-xlarge w3-padding-32">Processing</li>
         <li class="w3-padding-16">There were multiple pipelines of data processing. So our main data set consists of two sheets. One is a guide and one is the major bit of the data. The data portion was categorized into multiple categories: Impact, Policies and Capacities, and Context. We copy and pasted all the rows and sub columns from each subcategory to three new excel sheets. We also have one with all three excel sheets concatenated together. Then we uploaded this data into Tableau so that we can choose the parameters we would like to compare. Originally, it was very difficult to find conclusions from the data because there is so much data to look at and it was very easy to drown in the data. As Nathan Yau said, we had to learn to swim and navigate through the data. The way we did that was asking ourselves questions and trying to investigate specific parameters. This inspired us to ask questions about each other’s visualizations to answer more questions to build a stronger narrative to research questions.</li>

        <li class="w3-black w3-xlarge w3-padding-32">Presentation</li>
<li class="w3-padding-16">We ended up using Javascript to present our website. We took advantage of Tableau for all of our visualizations. We wanted to add pictures of the people from the regions in our pages in order to add some humanistic personality to the pages besides words and data only. We also use maps a lot to navigate through the site.
